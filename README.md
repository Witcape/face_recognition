# **Anti-Cheating Face Recognition System**

## **Overview**
The **Anti-Cheating Face Recognition System** is designed to prevent cheating in various contexts. It uses the **dlib** library for robust facial recognition. 

## **Features**
- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Customizable recognition threshold.
- Logging and reporting of detected faces.
